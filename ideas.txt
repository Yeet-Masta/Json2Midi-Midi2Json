Dynamic Tempo Changes:
Implement a system for dynamic tempo changes throughout the track. This could be done by adding a "tempoMap" feature that allows specifying tempo changes at specific delta times or measures.
Articulation Patterns:
Create a system for defining and applying articulation patterns (e.g., staccato, legato) that can be easily applied to note sequences.
Velocity Curves:
Implement velocity curves that can be applied to a series of notes, allowing for more natural-sounding dynamics in the MIDI output.
Chord Progressions:
Add a feature to define chord progressions that can be automatically expanded into individual notes or arpeggios.
Randomization:
Introduce controlled randomization for various MIDI parameters (e.g., slight variations in velocity or timing) to add a more human feel to the output.
Phrase Repetition with Variation:
Implement a system for repeating musical phrases with slight variations each time, such as changing the last few notes or altering the rhythm.
Scale-based Note Generation:
Add a feature to generate notes based on specified scales, allowing for easy creation of melodies that fit within a particular key.
Polyrhythm Support:
Implement support for polyrhythms, allowing different tracks to have different time signatures or rhythmic structures that align at larger intervals.
MIDI Effects:
Add support for MIDI effects like arpeggiators, note echoes, or chord splitters that can be applied to note sequences.
Adaptive Harmonization:
Create a system that can automatically generate harmony parts based on a given melody and chord progression.
Groove Templates:
Implement groove templates that can be applied to tracks, slightly adjusting the timing and velocity of notes to create different feels (e.g., swing, shuffle).
Conditional Track Muting:
Add a feature to conditionally mute or unmute entire tracks based on specified conditions, allowing for more dynamic arrangements.
Parameter Automation:
Implement a more robust system for automating MIDI controller changes over time, possibly using mathematical functions or predefined curves.
Pattern Transformations:
Add functions to transform patterns (e.g., invert, retrograde, transpose) that can be applied dynamically during pattern playback.
Event Probability:
Introduce a probability system for events, allowing certain notes or controls to have a chance of not being played or altered in some way.
